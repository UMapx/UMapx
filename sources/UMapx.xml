            The mode is calculated as <c>sqrt((2 * μ - 1) * ω / μ)</c>.
            The variance is defined only for <c>k &gt; 2/c</c>. For
            <c>k ≤ 2/c</c> the second moment diverges and the method
            returns <see cref="F:System.Single.PositiveInfinity"/>.
            Defined only when <c>k &gt; 3/c</c>; otherwise returns
            <see cref="F:System.Single.NaN"/>.
            for <c>k &gt; 4/c</c>; for <c>2/c &lt; k ≤ 4/c</c> the fourth moment
            diverges and the method returns <see cref="F:System.Single.PositiveInfinity"/>.
            For <c>k ≤ 2/c</c> the result is <see cref="F:System.Single.NaN"/>.
            Defined for all <c>c &gt; 0</c> and <c>k &gt; 0</c>.
            The distribution is defined for positive degrees of freedom
            <c>d1 &gt; 0</c> and <c>d2 &gt; 0</c>. Its median has no closed form and is
            computed numerically. More information can be found on the website:
            Gets the median value (computed numerically).
            The CDF is expressed through the regularized incomplete beta function
            after converting <paramref name="x"/> to the corresponding
            F-distribution variable.
            Uses Wilson–Hilferty approximation.
