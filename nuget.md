**UMapx.NET** is a cross-platform .NET library for digital signal processing.

# About
### Contains ready-made math tools:
* color spaces and their transformations,
* real and complex algebra,
* statistical distributions,
* special math functions,
* digital response filters,
* discrete orthogonal transforms and more.

### Suitable for a wide range of tasks:
* symbolic and graphical visualization of data,
* functional, vector and matrix analysis,
* interpolation, approximation and optimization of functions,
* numerical differentiation and integration,
* solving equations,
* matrix factorization.

### Includes special toolboxes:
* **Wavelet Toolbox**. Provides wide functionality for the study of discrete and continuous wavelets. The toolbox also includes algorithms for discrete one-dimensional and two-dimensional wavelet transforms of real and complex signals.
* **Window Toolbox**. Includes a set of tools for synthesizing and orthogonalizing window functions. It implements discrete short-time Fourier and Weyl-Heisenberg transforms for real and complex signals.
* **Image Processing Toolbox**. Contains efficient algorithms for processing, correcting, and analyzing 32-bit images.
* **Video Processing Toolbox**. Includes a set of tools for video streaming and processing.
